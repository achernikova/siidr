# Susceptible-Infected-Infected Dormant-Recovered (SIIDR) model for self-propagating malware (SPM)
Code for Modeling Self-Propagating Malware with Epidemiological Models manuscript (https://appliednetsci.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s41109-023-00578-z)
where we propose a new epidemiological-inspired model for SPM, called SIIDR, and extensively study its essential characteristics.

Language: python 3.9
Dependencies: scipy 1.9.3, scikit-learn 1.0.2, pandas 1.4.2, numpy 1.21.5, networkx 2.8.8, igraph
